\subsection*{Forming Groups}

For this project, you must work in groups of 2 or 3 students. Please formalise your groups in Canvas in the People area. If you're struggling to find someone to work with, there is a thread in the Discussion Board where you can reach out to other students to form groups.

\subsection*{Proposal}

The purpose of the proposal is to give you a mechanism to get early feedback on your ideas for the project so that you don't pursue a project that is not viable. The proposal is unweighted, but it will give you an opportunity to outline the plan for your project and me as Course Coordinator the chance to provide guidance or steer you in the right direction as needed. For the proposal, please provide a description of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The data:} What data are you going to use? Will you use a real data set or instead performing simulations? If using a real data set, where will you obtain the data? How big will the sample size be? If performing simulations, how many simulations do you intend to perform? What will you be computing in each simulation?
    \item \textbf{The methods you will use to analyse the data:} You must include up to 3 methods we have learned about in STAT2300. What will these methods be able to illuminate about the data?
\end{itemize}

After your group's proposal is approved, you can proceed with the project.

\subsection*{Project}

With the project, you will apply 3 or more concepts from STAT2300 to your chosen data set or simulation design. The project should be a comprehensive written document and it should include the following sections:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction:} In this section, you will provide an overview of the application or theoretical area for your project. Through the methods you will employ, what will you explore about the particular application or theoretical domain you have chosen?
    \item \textbf{Data or Simulation Design:} In this section, you will provide a full description of the data you will be analysing. More specifically,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If you are using a real data set, provide the source of the data set, a description of all of the variables, and the sample size.
        \item If you are performing simulations, fully describe the simulation design, including the number of simulations you will be performing and the objects you will create to store the information from the simulations.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Topics Covered:} In this section, you will list 3 or more methods from STAT2300 that you will apply to the data, and what you will use them for.
    \item \textbf{Results:} In this section, you will apply the methods from the previous section to the data set and provide a full code or working to obtain the results. Note: your work must be completely reproducible. This means:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If you make use of any functions contained in add-in packages, you must list these packages and include the appropriate call to library() to load the functions within your code.
        \item If you perform any random number generation or random sampling, you must set the seed of the random number generation with the set.seed() function.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conclusion:} In this section, you will summarise the results and describe what they illustrate about the application or theoretical domain you've mentioned in the introduction.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Presentation}

In your presentation, your group will have 8 minutes to present your project to the rest of the class during the lab in Week 12. Your presentation should be accompanied by some visual content, such as slides. There are various ways you might format your presentation, but one structure which might work well:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction:} introduce the subject area of your project and why it is interesting. Perhaps briefly indicate the techniques your group applied. ($\sim$2 minutes)
    \item \textbf{Results:} provide an overview of the results of your project. You don't need to showcase all of the code, but report the main results and how they are meaningful to the subject area. ($\sim$5 minutes)
    \item \textbf{Conclusion:} provide a summary of your findings and what your group learned about the subject area. ($\sim$1 minute)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}
The importance of understanding the diabetes dataset it to further our knowledge of what the key causes of diabetes are, and how they can be predicted. The dataset contains 11 variables, and the target variable is the progression of diabetes. The dataset contains 442 observations and 11 variables and we are understanding the factors involved which are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf age    - age in years
    \item \textbf sex    - male and female
    \item \textbf bmi    - body mass index
    \item \textbf bp     - average blood pressure
    \item \textbf s1     - TC: total serum cholesterol
    \item \textbf s2     - LDL: low-density lipoproteins
    \item \textbf s3     - HDL: high-density lipoproteins
    \item \textbf s4     - TCH: total cholesterol / HDL
    \item \textbf s5     - LTG: possibly log of serum triglycerides level
    \item \textbf s6     - GLU: blood sugar level
    \item \textbf target - measure of disease progression one year after baseline
\end{itemize}
Each of the feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the square root of the number of sample.

Our investigation is to look at the more commonly known variables that affect the progression of diabetes in the observations of this dataset. These are more specifically age and BMI. We will be using the maximum likelihood estimation method to estimate the parameters of the linear regression model for the progression of diabetes based on BMI, then using the model we will do a comparison study on how age combined with BMI affects the progression of diabetes compared to BMI alone.

We will compute 95\% confidence intervals for the parameters estimated in our MLE model using the likelihood interval obtained earlier. This will provide a range of plausible values for each parameter in the population, helping us understand the uncertainty in our estimates.

We will use the bootstrap method to construct confidence intervals for the correlation coefficient between blood pressure and diabetes progression. This non-parametric approach will allow us to make inferences about the strength of this relationship in the population without making strong distributional assumptions.

\section{Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)}
<<echo=TRUE>>=
head(ddat)

neg_log_likelihood <- function(params, data) {
  # Extract the parameters
  beta0 <- params[1]        # Intercept
  beta1 <- params[2]        # Slope
  sigma <- params[3]        # Standard Deviation
  
  # Extract dependent and independent variables
  x <- ddat$bmi
  y <- ddat$target
  
  # Predicted value of a linear model
  y_pred <- beta0 + beta1 * x
  
  # Log-likelihood for normal distribution
  norm_log_likelihood <- -sum(dnorm(y, mean = y_pred, sd = sigma, log = TRUE))
  
  return(norm_log_likelihood)
}
# Now to use optim() to minimise the negative log-likelihood and estimate params
int_params <- c(beta0 = 0, beta1 = 0, sigma = 1)

mle <- optim(
  par = int_params,           # Initial guess
  fn = neg_log_likelihood,    # The function being minimised
  data = ddat,                # Data to be used
  method = "BFGS",            # Optimisation method (less fragile and more common)
  hessian = TRUE              # Return Hessian for variance estimation
)

# Results
mle$par

# Predicted values from the model put back into likelihood function for LP
y_pred <- mle$par[1] + mle$par[2] * ddat$bmi

# Residuals
residuals <- ddat$target - y_pred

# Plot residuals to check for patterns
plot(ddat$bmi, residuals, main = "Residuals vs BMI", xlab = "BMI", ylab = "Residuals")
@
\subsection*{MLE Data Analysis}
With the assumption that the data is of a normal distribution and follows linear regression beta0 = 21.86, indicates that this is your progression if your BMI was 0, this is unrealistic as no one has this, the slope being labelled beta1 = 0.31 indicates every BMI increment of 1 would increase progression by 0.31 showing a small positive association which is reasonable, and standard deviation being 4102.63 is unrealistically high implying that BMI alone is not enough to determine the progression of diabetes based on the model or there is outlier variance that is just not explained by BMI. This is reasonable given the data is 10 measured variables and you would assume that the other 9 are not all redundant and cannot be predicted by BMI alone even though there is some correlation.

\section{Likelihood Ratio Test}
<<echo=TRUE>>=
# Fitting Model 1: Progression ~ BMI
model1 <- lm(target ~ bmi, data = ddat)

# Fitting Model 2: Progression ~ BMI + Age
model2 <- lm(target ~ bmi + age, data = ddat)

# Summarise the models
summary(model1)
summary(model2)

# Extract the log-likelihood for both models
logLik_model1 <- logLik(model1)
logLik_model2 <- logLik(model2)

# Print the log-likelihoods (optional)
logLik_model1
logLik_model2

# Calculate the likelihood ratio test statistic
LRT_stat <- 2 * (logLik_model2 - logLik_model1)

# Degrees of freedom is the difference in the number of parameters
df <- df.residual(model1) - df.residual(model2)

# Compute the p-value for the test
p_value <- pchisq(LRT_stat, df = df, lower.tail = FALSE)

# Print the result
cat("Likelihood Ratio Test Statistic:", LRT_stat, "\n")
cat("p-value:", p_value, "\n")
@
\subsection*{Likelihood Ratio Test Analysis}
Given the p-value is such a small number being less than 0.05, it can be concluded that the model with BMI and age is a better fit than the model with BMI as the only constituent and the likelihood ratio test backs up this data and indicates a large improvement. This was almost assumed given the data in the set has 10 variables and would be poorly constructed if so many were redundant which concludes through testing and general reasoning that adding additional variables will contribute to the accuracy of the model.

\section{Confidence Intervals using the Newton-Raphson Method}

We will compute 95\% confidence intervals for the parameters estimated in our MLE model using the likelihood interval obtained through the Newton-Raphson method. This will provide a range of plausible values for each parameter in the population, helping us understand the uncertainty in our estimates.
